America
since it’s formative phase as an illegitimate combination between an abstracted puritan ethical social values and the mentality of the modernist economic utilitarian efficiency has been in a conflict with it’s self, to solve such a structural 
Autoiated deficiencies,it considered it’s self as a manifested word of god,which is destined to have an unquestionable practical legitimacy,thus every harm which it inflicts upon any other being cannot be categorised as un-toleratable until it’s evolved consequence is affecting it,the american mentality here purses a tricky procedural pattern,it reconstructs the structural nature of its aggression to benefit from it, and as long as it is beneficial,it is unquestionably self-legitimate.

This mentality is still present in the american psyche even after the post-modernist conceptual crisis

And only god can now how it would react to un-deter-able ￼reality of absolute comprehensive collapse since it was brought to the presence in this world,and may god protect us.
