We have the will to extinguish the desire of the abstracted entity of the status quo, we have the will of the complex being to stop the cyclic flow of the procces of becoming which has no fundamental functionality other than the elimination of the ability to un-conceal the will to formulate a descriptive and a hermeneutical understanding of our being in its form within being, and the former cannot be achieved in any way other than the adherence to the adequacy of the pure action as an abstract extension of the will of our considerations and perceptions about the points of the transcendental dimension of logos which our nature could be a manifested value and reflection of.

Die as a result 

Kill as a will of being what is higher than your mere self, thus achieve the full possibilities of your Dasien

Sing with the rhythms of confrontation with the end of times, not only for changing it, bur surpassing it as a (self)

Come to the experimental field to understand your real whatness

And disappear as an extension of a populist phenomenon denied from conceptual solid bases

Bury yourself in being to dodge the arbitrary madness of the constant disgusting unstable becoming

Ask to be what your are capable of being

And be lost within its spectrum 

And love yourself as a will to hate the degenerated 

To be able to resurrect from this process of mystical revelation and realisation of what you can be, and to become to be.

Then, be the apollonian ponitefix of light, which can understand how not to be overwhelmed by darkness as a result of what is apparently present at hand phenomenally 

Thus, you will fast from absorbing the unstable paradigm which you are confronting and prevent it from dwelling in your {one-self}  .
