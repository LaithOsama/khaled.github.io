When mere sensible axiomatical facts have the potentially of being faked, imagine the evil that can be as a leading theological path for the mechanical human masses which are lead by the tendency of following things as they appear to the abstract collective unconsciousness which is directed to the myth of the absolute transcendent facticity of what appears as a natural incarnation of their arbitrary perception of what the abstract human nature is (which never existed), in this realm, every man is a victim of arbitrary trust of the faked BEING which is an incarnation of the utilitarian arbitrary BECOMING , in the traditionalistic paradigm, this problem is surpassed and over-came totally, the metaphysical is presented and incarnated in all beings and natures, thus, every phenomenon ( if hermeneutically understood according to the systematic hierarchy of descriptive symbolic values) is a dimensional representation of what transcends all beings through making them part of a greater (space), and through achieving oneself not as an individualistic or collective humanistic perception, but through making them a reflective dimensional aspect of (truth), and if you fight these beings which acquired these values through achieving absolute stability of the ontological state of formulation, then you are an absolute enemy, and we will do everything practically possible to halt your corruption.

Every phenomenon which is limited to the form of its presence is fake, deceiving, without a soul, and a delusion.

When the phenomenal reality is a result of an ontological connection to what formulates the sacred in it’s self, then it is a mere gate to understand and “live” spiritually what is real, absolute, existent in all dimensional aspects of the whole being, in this form, reality is sacred, worth of being (defended), and worth of human sacrifice.
