He stood within the constant flowing current of the water of the arbitrary change, which came from the sea of the fad and the indefinite, predetermined teleologically yet structural non-existent, that was the water which sought to drown him, yet he stood on the ground which he had chosen, the ground which is in harmony with his self-formulation, the ground which is a destiny for the pure, and yet once its chosen, the purification is the destiny of its choosers, it is not a destiny in itself self, but it is the departure for what the man is destined to be, as long as he defined the self as a separate boundary from the present and apparent demons of the water, it is the war of the absolute fixed and clearly structured land ￼against the indefinite formless water

Which once it wears a form,  it rejects it’s primordial content, and once it returns to the predetermined and formulated content, it loses any possible structural form as a result , it is the water of the dajjal.
