A man is either a realisation of the transcendental possibilities which his being is capable of having an acquisition of, a grasping which reveals the limitations beyond those which are sensed by mere immediate speculation of intuition, through an experimental absorption of what he could be as a meaning within his spectrum of being, or be overwhelmed by the superficial facts of the current actuality of his presence as a whole of interactive nature with external beings and selfs {selbst}

The life of the resistant being which is opposed towards the considerations of arbitrary popularized comfort is the life which has the possibility to be the spectrum of the achievement of practical acquisition of his being, not through facts in an abstract sense, but through living the logos in all of their formative dimensional possibilities of being{ as a verb}.

Maybe that’s the reason why the islamic tradition insists on the jihad of the self towards re-formulating the self before it engages in interaction with other selfs, through this reformulation, the indefinite abstract human nature becomes a phenomenon which is un-concealed, it’s objectives, functionalites, and it’s highest teleological goals of actualising it’s formulated self are clear, graspable for the adequate descriptive intellect, which interprets it in accordance to its own nature, which needs to understand it’s self in that way which is not effected by the the external temporal situationalites of other beings

And the achievement of this possibility is the highest point of piety and connection to the paradigm which the lord has given to the human element.
