The most preliminary logical task of an ethical philosopher is not to formulate a conceptuality of regulating the behavioral intentionality of a human element when it encounters what is in his immediate world which is at his disposal, his correct preliminary task is forming a conceptual cognition of what the ethics is attempting to be sovereign upon, whether it is the reality it’s self in it’s ontic practical form, or in it’s ontological abstract intuition of the individual, which is not separable from the collective socialized awareness and consciousness, which doesn’t only relate to the individual perceptual cognition in determining what is right or wrong, but it determines the course of considerations which the human element perceives, it has another form of being sovereign, the collective determines what the human perceive, not necessarily how it is perceived, it determines what the human dasein encounters with in the world, it’s metaphysical determinist aspect is present in the manifestation of reality, thus, reality is not separable from the social, except in a rhetoric emotionalistic human self-perceived ego, thus ethics (and by extension, morality) is either a compliance, a rebellious revolt, or a re-interpretation of that collective phenomenal reality, and an absolute surpassing of that cannot be except a post-ethical psychological paranoia.
