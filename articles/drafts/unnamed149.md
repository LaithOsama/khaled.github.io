The biggest fear which any philosopher must have is the extent of the effect of the procedural protocol of the hermeneutical inference which people apply through a mechanic manifestation imposed on the real {whatness ~ ماهية} of his dynamic rationalization and demonizing it through making a consideration about it as a result of a certain perception they have about a certain occurrence in their lifes with absolute disregard to it’s real being and situationally (i refer here to Husserl’s intentionality), this mechanism can be an indication of the extent of disgusting natures which human intuition is capable of formulating it’s self upon as a mere {desire}, maybe Heidegger rejected the connection between a philosopher’s life and his philosophy, because people tend to make a presumption of {desired rational perception of the thing and interpreting it descriptively on the base of the the supposition of the former as an authentic primacy of it as a factical intuition which lack the solid conceptualization, thus, lives an existential crisis which is present is long as the above mentioned mechanical algorithm is carried on}.


And even when this problem is solved, the logos cannot be understood unless they are lived, on all aspects of their being.
