History is a matter of studying the available records which document the definitive characteristics of a certain event, yet the utilisation of this method cannot be achieved (if the formative nature of the method it’s self is not pushed to the furthest extent possible ) is not achievable without a conceptual analysis of the context of the procedural formation of the events, mainly that of (categorisation), this overlooked aspect doesn’t only cause an avoidable obscurity in the descriptive interpretation of the events in determining what they have resulted in (on the aspect of articulated reality or a conceptual consequence ) 
But also allows for a complete destructive collective anthropological examination of the human mentalities ( under the assumption of the existence of human psychological universal patterns of pathology, which i regard as absolutely false).
