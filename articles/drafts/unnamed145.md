I will not talk about the contradictions between the liberal slogans which they identify their essence and functionalities and the very legitimacy of being on the necks of the people and between their practical behavioural pattern and procedural methodologies, the above mentioned point is manifested in history for the the vision of the abstract simple human eye which senses the mere phenomenas, i will regard and illustrate more important things:

I have never known her on a personal direct aspect of communication (unlike her father, which is my teacher on philosophical and traditional metaphysical aspect), but i know her through of participation in the same situatedness which we have decided cognitively to un-conceal our absolute conceptual definition and practical struggle against the liberal empire and its degenerated agents of influence which cannot sense the most apparent phenomenons of their constant process of decay, we understand that our nature which we have formulated in a certain transcendental direction above the incarnations of the whole of status quo will be in sustainable chain of experimental conflict with the symptoms of the demonic decay of kali-yoga, thus, we don’t consider out death as a matter of a boundary limitation, but as the furthest extent of purification of the soul on a singular level, absolute detachment of the presence in the world of demons as beings, but we the our purified transcendence achieves the presence of it’s effects and occurrence, which will not be achieved by a pattern other than absolute full confrontation on all aspects of being, and this orientation is super-imposed upon ourselves by the very competents which constitute our (self), our civilizational dasein, darya is a living and example to illustrate this status of existential power.

They attempted to target our father, yet the apparent truth is not grasped by their disables mentalities, they don’t understand that this father is incarcerated in thousands of sons which followed him with the tendency towards the absolute truth to grasp dominance over the temporal enemy which will be killed inevitably, they don’t understand that he is incarnated with all of his capabilities in all the logos of struggle against their corrupt paradigm 

My absolute heartily condolences towards
Alexandr Dugin, from a student son to his father.

Your dear faithful son, khalid addressed you and continues to :

We have taken the cognitive decision of achieving sovereignty over the reality of becoming through detesting it’s line of phenomenons, thus, we are fully aware that a confrontation will manifestation itself from this contradiction between two separate perceptions about what being should be, and martyrdom is embodied in the above-mentioned possibility of comprehensive sovereignty, preceding any temporal consideration, and surpassing every practical consequence on the singular level, this is, the pure action.

This process of realisation of our extents is the test of our purity as carries of absolute dedication towards our noble theological aim, the empire,thus, we need to stay fixed in our pre-determined situatedness, and i can proudly say, darya fulfilled the essential requirements of being pure
