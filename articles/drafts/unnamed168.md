Poverty makes the desperate people incapable of comprehending and processing what a solution is, they just rage and act in absolute accordance to the sufferings they sustained and use what is available at hand to destroy everything which they perceive as a contributing factor to their status quo, and unfortunately, this category can include anything which they intend to perceive as such a factor with these characteristics, the human nature which in itâ€™s manifestation within a context of such a chaos is pathologically disturbing .

The illegitimate son of poverty (especially in the post modernist bourgeois socio-economic system) is the criminal revolution and the conceptualised principle which are driven from it

In a world like ours, which any form of legitimacy is based upon the economic efficiency, a manifestation of such a tendency which will occur when the required circumstances are embedded into a present reality, would be the hardest and most terrifying.
